# BankLoanApprovalPrediction

Web-App: https://bank-loan-predictor.nn.r.appspot.com/

Every bank wants to check their customers profile before giving them a loan.

About Dataset: This dataset is taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset/data

This dataset is for a Multistate bank with following columns:

column name, Loan ID usage in the project loan_id unused variable. Gender, used as input. Married, used as input. Dependents, used as input. Education, used as input. Self_Employed, used as input. ApplicantIncome, used as input. CoapplicantIncome, used as input. LoanAmount, used as input. Loan_Amount_Term, used as input. Credit_History, used as input. Property_Area, used as input. Loan_Status, used as the target. Y if the loan is approved or N for not approved.

Aim of the project is to Predict the loan approval for different customer using Machine Learning algorithms. Since this is a binary classification problem, I used Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and Naive Bayes algorithms. Among them, Naive Bayes outperforms all other algorithms.
